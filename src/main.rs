//Fn Decide how to measure similarity 
//Fn find social circles (would these be subtrees with the main tree? What directed graph type should I use) Could I use graph clustering if I only have nodes and edges? Would I be doing that? Is what Iâ€™m doing graph clustering? Do I need more data to graph cluster?
//Fn find social circles
//Fn compare social circle
//Fn likelihood of someone in one social circle being connected to someone in a dif social circle
